# TitanicKaggleML: Use case and main notes

This GitHub repository showcases the EDA and ML models performed on the Titanic's Kaggle competition datasets (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data).

The main goal of this project is to predict which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck. The dataset is divided into two parts: train.csv and test.csv. The train.csv dataset contains the details of a subset of the passengers on board (891 passengers), whereas the test.csv dataset contains the details of a different subset of passengers (418 passengers). The train.csv dataset is used to build the machine learning models. For the passengers in the test.csv dataset, the outcome (whether or not the passenger survived) is withheld.
